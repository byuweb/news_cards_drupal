INTRODUCTION
------------

Because Storify is shutting down, this module provides a way to display social
media embed code and external pages in a card-like format similar to Storify. It
creates paragraph types and a content type that will display a list of the
stories a user enters. The paragraphs and lists contain minimal styling so the
user can style them to match their needs.
